Hematology Web
Hematology Web is a comprehensive web application designed to assist in the diagnosis of anemia and the classification of white blood cells using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. This project leverages machine learning to determine anemia based on hematological parameters and deep learning to classify different types of white blood cells from images.

Features
Anemia Diagnosis
Input Parameters: Accepts hematological values such as Hemoglobin (Hb), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), and gender.
Anemia Detection: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to determine if the given values indicate anemia.
White Blood Cell Classification
Image Input: Accepts images of white blood cells.
Cell Type Identification: Uses deep learning models to classify the given image as one of the following cell types:
Monocyte
Lymphocyte
Neutrophil
Eosinophil
